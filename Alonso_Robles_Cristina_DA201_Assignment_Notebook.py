# # Course 2: Data Analytics using Python

# ## Assignment: Diagnostic Analysis using Python
# 
# Youâ€™ll be working with real-world data to address a problem faced by the National Health Service (NHS). The analysis will require you to utilise Python to explore the available data, create visualisations to identify trends, and extract meaningful insights to inform decision-making. 

# ### A note for students using this template
# This Jupyter Notebook is a template you can use to complete the Course 2 assignment: Diagnostic Analysis using Python.
